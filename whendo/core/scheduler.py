    An instance of the Scheduler class schedules Action instances using the Python 'schedule' library. This
    library schedules and runs 'jobs'. A submitted job can be any zero-arg Callable.
    
        https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    
    All Schedulers can limit the time during the day that their jobs run by setting the 'start' and 'stop'
    fields to instances of the 'datetime.datetime.time' class.
    
    examples:
        start=time(8,0,0) stop=time(18,0,0) limits execution to the time between 8:00 and 18:00
        start=time(18,0,0) stop=time(8,0,0) limits execution to the time between 18:00 and 8:00
    
    note:
        1. This (start, stop) in-period feature is implemented outside of the workings of the schedule library since schedule's schedule build 
           mechanism does not support it. So it's done using a less than optimal approach that alters the execution
           behavior within a scheduled job. Outside of the specified period, a job will be run. It just won't do anything. [see do_nothing below]
